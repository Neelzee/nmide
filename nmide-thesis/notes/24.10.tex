I can't for the life of me do JS-Plugin support, shit sucks.
Should I ditch React and just do TS/JS? IDK, man.


\section{24.10.09}

I need a View for the frontend, and one for the backend, and finally, one for
coalescing both of them.


\section{24.10.10}

I'll drop first-class-plugin support for JavaScript, and instead just allow
plugins to create script-tags, which can do whatever. I can reuse the asset
logic I've used when I attempted the full support of JavaScript, but there are
a lot of cooler code-samples I can't use, but hopefully write a little about,
since I've fallen for functional TypeScript. It is what it is.

I think my commit history will be fucked. Since I've been working on a branch
with the idea of squashing commits, and therefore ignoring standard commit
message etiquette.
