Previously I tried to basically create vs code. The attempt would've work, in the sense I would probably have a
finished product by the end of the year. The general idea, was make a basic IDE, and then make plugins for it,
extending the IDE. Work on one plugin at the time, and creating the functionality needed (in the core IDE) for
the plugin to work. This would've been the easy way out. But it would suck as a developer, to create new plugins.
When I figured this out, I only had a shitty file explorer, so no time lost (except 5-6 months on and off work).

Now I am working on something close to what my supervisor wanted, a purely modular application, where all functionality
comes from plugins. While this is \textit{harder} to develop, it will be easier to create plugins for. So, for topics,
I think I should pivot towards lifetime of an application. Since, this new way, will increase the lifetime of the IDE,
since any shitty plugin I make, is \textit{easy} to make better, in what ever language they want.

To do this, I need C, and when developing in C, I need tests.

I've finished a lot of tests for the C library, they suck, and don't have proper documentation nor cover all the edge cases,
but, they exist, and are in the pipelines. I also kinda finished the types in the C library. I am working on the wrapper, but
it's hard, mostly because I don't know if what I am doing will work, and it seems like a waste coding without knowing if it's
useful.

So, instead of doing that, I moved on to the core-functionality, plugin management. Well, a basic form, since all it should do,
is load plugins, and call them. That's what I will start with, but eventually, I need some form of API/ABI/Interface so that a
\textit{manager} plugin can call other plugins, or at least decide what happens when.

I also need some integration tests, but I am currently unsure on how to do that. Or what the best practice is.
