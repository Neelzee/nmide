\section{24.09.04}

Created my own Gitlab runner. Out of an old laptop. It did not work out of the box, but I hope
I can get it work by the end of today.

(1 minute later)

I dont know why, but my runner is disabled for 1 hour. Cool beans.

\dots

I re-installed debian on the old laptop, and registered the runner on the laptop, instead of
through SSH, but this did not work either. I also added a runner on my current laptop, and
this worked, somehow. But it was a flakey process. I saw on some forums that I should run
gitlab-runner with sudo, but this did not work on my machine, neither did without, it was
just stuck, it seemed. I finally ran it with the --debug flag, and then it worked.

I can now see that downloading 2G might be slower than just building it.

The pipelines take a ridicolus amount of time to run, so I should look into splitting them up
there is no need to run them for every little commit. This is a tomorrow me's problem, however.
I am also noticing that my desktop is lagging when being used as a runner, so I should enable
the shared runners for those jobs that it can run (by using tags).

I also need to check out the test coverage being created for nmide-core, it is not working for
some reason.
