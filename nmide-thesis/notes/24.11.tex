I have done it, I don't really know what I have done differently, but it works.
There is still the issue with Msg not being registered correctly, but I think
that's an easy fix.

We had a Magnolia Workshop this week, learned \textit{some} stuff, like, the
IDE and Compiler should communicate using LSP, (insane!). But more interesting
stuff, I have a lot of UX I need to consider, my supervisors expect IDE
functionality, and I should make a wishlist of Plugins to develop.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Plugin Debugger
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Display State
    \item Display Msg's being sent
    \item Check if there are state collisions
    \item Check if there are Msg collisions
  \end{itemize}
  \item Dependency Viewer
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Showcase JS
  \end{itemize}
  \item File Explorer
  \item Text Editor
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use existing JS
  \end{itemize}
  \item Rendering Framework
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Facilitate ease of pre-DOM-manipulation
  \end{itemize}
  \item Mini-LSP-Client
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Hover functionality
    \item GOTO Declaration
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In state changes, plugins should only return \textit{what} they change, not the
entire state. I think this will be a good change, since not only will it ensure
that overrides are easier to detect, (since we can compare states), states from
plugins are smaller, and there will be less unnecessary duplications.

Again, unit tests should've been made ages ago, my state coalescing in the
frontend should've had unit tests. I'll make some next time.
