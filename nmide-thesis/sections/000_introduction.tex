\section{Introduction}

Standard Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are indispensable tools in software development,
offering features like early bug reporting, project outline visualization, code highlighting, and code completion
However, these IDEs may not adequately support the unique demands of experimental programming languages
In response, this project proposes a modular IDE designed to extend its lifespan and provide enhanced support
for experimental languages.
