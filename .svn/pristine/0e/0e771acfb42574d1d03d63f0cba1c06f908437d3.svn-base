\section{What is Nmide}

Nmide is a zero-core application. It has no existing functionality, except
managing Modules, which give the application features. It achives this by using
two kinds of Modules, compile-time and runtime. Compile-time modules can only be
added during compilation of the application, and cannot be removed afterwards.
Runtime modules are modules which are added after compilation, and can be
removed. Removal or addition of a module during application uptime will not
cause the Module to be added, the application has to restart for the removal or
addition to take effect.
