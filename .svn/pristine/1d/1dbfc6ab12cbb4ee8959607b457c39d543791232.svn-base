\section{Multi-way Dataflow Constraint System} \label{sec:mdcs}

One thing this application does not provide a solution for, is the difficulty
in designing good \gls{gui}. Following the \gls{mvc}-pattern, \gls{gui}s can
represent structures such as lists, which users might want to manipulate in
some fashion, like appending or rearranging the items in the list. Managing such
a change, especially one that involves \gls{gui} widgets can be a challenge,
since a change in the view should be reflected in the model, and encoding this
can be very involved. Luckily, there exists frameworks that make this task
easier. \textit{WarmDrink}, \cite{warmDrink, dslMdcs} is a JavaScript
framework that allow a developer to declarative specify structural changes in
an application. This can be achieved, since the \gls{ide} exposes a simple
\gls{api} for runtime systems. A runtime system specifically for a \gls{mdcs}
could be implemented for JavaScript modules. This could also be done for the
Rust modules, by utilizing the crate developed by Svartveit. \cite{mcdsRust}
The module developer experience is important, so it's good that there exist
\gls{mdcs} tooling to ease a module developers experience. \cite{toolMcds}

Another issue in \gls{gui}s is optimizing performance in regard to events
triggered by user actions, such as scrolling, resizing or typing. These events
could happen many times in a second, while in theory user speed is trivial for a
computer to keep up with, there are instances where a module family could be
quite large, meaning many different modules are triggered by the same event many
times. There are techniques, called event coalescing, for handling this, like
debouncing and throttling.

\paragraph{Debouncing} Debouncing is a technique where you delay the sending of
an event until after some time period $T$ has passed. Once the event is triggered
$T_0$ starts counting down. If the same event is re-triggered while $T_0 > 0$,
$T_0$ is reset by $T_0 = T$. If $T_0 = 0$, then the event is sent. Ensuring that
$T$ is not too large, is important, as if $T$ is above some threshold, the user
of the \gls{gui} will notice, and it will make the application \textit{feel}
slow.

\paragraph{Throttling} Throttling is a similar technique to debouncing, except
instead of delaying the event by some time $T$, the event is only sent when
$T_0 = 0$. Meaning the event is sent at regular intervals, and could be sent at
the exact same point in time when the user triggered the event, or it could
happen at most, $T$ units after the user action.

Debouncing and throttling work in less complex \gls{gui} structures, but as the
amount of features in an application increases, the complexity will also
increase. These event-coalescing-strategies are a source of subtle bugs, as
event coalescing can easily break modularity. In a \gls{jsms}, this issue could
be solved by using \textit{flushable promises} \cite{flush}. This could have
solved our issue, where we had some Event handler that took noticeably longer
time to return, but since this was a Rust-Module, we could \textit{solve} this
by doing this computation on another thread. If it was a JavaScript module we
could have solved it by using \textit{flushable promises}.

If we implement a \gls{ls}-client in JavaScript, \textit{flushable promises}
could allow for a smoother experience, as things like \textit{looking up}
renaming in a Magnolia project is a more involved process for the compiler,
and in larger projects, could take a noticeably long time.


\section{Automated Testing}

Due to the extensive modularity of the application, all modules can be tested
individually, by \textit{mocking} the expected state and events. This means that
breaking changes in one module can be detected before \gls{e2e} testing, which
is expensive. But this can only verify the general logic of a module and module
family, not the UI. To achieve such automation, one could rely on an automated
testing framework, like the one in \cite{autoUi}. Or if one is working with a
\textit{simple} JavaScript runtime, one could use third party software like
\textit{Playwright} for creating tests, as it can auto generate the \gls{dsl},
while the developer uses the module or entire \gls{ide} if it is an \gls{e2e}
test. This would help a module developer to discover behavior that a user might
not expect \cite{leastGui}.


\section{Abstract Algebra}

Magnolia is a kind of algebraic specification language, like CafeOBJ
\cite{cafeObj}. An algebraic specification language, is a language where one can
develop similarly as to how one might create an algebraic structure. As shown in
the development of this \gls{ide}, this can be quite useful way of thinking.


\section{Syntactic Theory Functor}

\gls{stf} is used by the compiler \cite{wiig} for stuff. Amongst them being
resolving renaming, and flatting the \gls{asr} to be shown to the developer.
