\section{25.02.28}

I've been writing since January. I got 42 pages. Which is \textit{fun}, in the
sense, I don't have to worry much about writing for the end of my semester, but
on the implementation, is where I am struggling, atm. I am still working on the
refactoring, and I just don't have the energy to mess around. I just want it to
work, which makes it harder to make it work, because I think I need to do
another round of FAFO before it'll work, ish.

This is also a reason for not writing any notes, these are mostly for when I am
developing, and need something to look at when I am writing, not the otherway
around. But I felt like I needed/should do a little status rapport, since next
week, I have a presentation about my thesis, (which is also a reason for me
writing so much), but I don't think I have it in me to do more presentation
work, mostly because I can only talk for 12 minutes, and I have 42 slides.
