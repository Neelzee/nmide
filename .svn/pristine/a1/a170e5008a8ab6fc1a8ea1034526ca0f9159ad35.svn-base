\begin{definition}[Frontend]
  The application is divided into two parts. The Frontend and Backend. The
  Frontend is referring to the code found in core/app. It communicates with the
  Backend with a client, either the builtin Tauri client from the Tauri
  framework, or a custom one, if the application is running as a server. This
  custom client is a simple JavaScript client, using fetch to send HTTP request
  to the Backend.
