# Nmide-Rust-FFI

Wrapper Crate for Nmide, to interact with `Nmide-Lib`.


## How it works

Using [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen), a basic Rust-C-FFI is created.
However, this uses a lot of `unsafe`-types, -functions, which are unsafe, and 
not as easy to work with. Therefore, this wrapper library can act as a safe translation
between the C way and Rust way.
