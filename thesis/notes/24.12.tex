\section{24.12.01}

Using Monaco will be more difficult that I first imagined. And by that, I mean
I can't simply wrap a trivial plugin around the library, and then use it. There
are some extra functionality/configurations that are needed, which I do not
know. Hopefully I'll figure this out, but I'll postpone this work until later,
since I'd rather not mess around with that this year. But I probably will. I
should create extensive documentation on the core IDE functionality, so that I
have something to write about, and to see if I have thought of everything.
Having to explain everything, will make it easier to see if I have made the
right decision, or just a decision.

I think today, I'll quickly look at turning the IDE into a server


\section{24.12.07}

I've almost turned the IDE into a server, got some CORS-issues, which as usual
is the bane of my existence. Fixing it should be easy, but I don't think I will
prioritize it in the coming days. I learned that after I am done with my
education at UIB, they will delete my account, and therefore my repository. So
I think as part of my redo/fix my CI/CD-job, I'll also look into migrating from
GitLab to GitHub. Once that has been completed, I need to plan the IDE-Plugin's
I am going to make, I need a plan, not only to make the development easier, but
also so, in case I do not have anything substantial to showcase, I can instead
say, oh this? This is just a prototype of my awesome plan.
