Wasted the whole day, trying to build the rust code using flakes. Did not get it
to work, and noticed I don't get any LSP help, probably due to linking issues. I
think the best solution is to distro-jump to Debian, which \textit{just works},
and add Nix as a package which I could use for development. Getting stuff to
work in on NixOs is hard, probably in some part due to me not reading the
documentation that well. Or being able to find the documentation.
Regardless, there is some restructuring in the code that is ahead of me, I need
to be finished with the implementation stuff in two weeks, at the end of April
at the latest.

I think I'll just write some stuff, and hope it works, code-wise, until I get a
proper environment setup.

Got stuff to work, back on Debian again. I think I should just rewrite the base
to use \textit{regular} Rust stuff, so none of the ABI stuff. This will simplify
the code, while still allowing me to keep the stuff I've written about, since I
can talk about \textit{it would be cool if \dots}, instead of having to actually
implement the cool stuff.
