\section{25.05.01}

Taking a break from writing, doing some development, since I've handed a draft
in for feedback. But now I am finding a lot of grammatical mistakes everywhere.

I should note the need for a more specialized optimization in appendix A, as
we can optimize instructions across the type parameter, based on if the node a
text or attr instruction wants to modify, exists or not.

I can also add a lot of text about the module-tester implementation, as that is
what I have been working on. At least the Rust side. I think I can finish some
basic analyzing today.
