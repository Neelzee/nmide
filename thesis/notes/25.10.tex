\section{25.10.24}

I have possibly seven days until my thesis defence.

Here is the plan for how I want the defence to go:

I want to start by doing a quick introduction about the thesis itself, which
should mention that this is not an IDE, but a concept of a platform for creating
an IDE.

Then I should talk about IDEs, but by prefacing with something like "But why do
we need such a modular and composable platform? Keep this in mind while I give a
quick introduction on how IDEs work."

Then I'll talk about IDEs.

"These features makes development easier, but these features can be difficult to
implement for languages that are more esoteric."

Then I'll talk about Magnolia, highlighting instances in which IDE features are
difficult to implement.

Then I'll show/talk a little about the architecture, highlighting how it allows
modules to act like microservices, which is a tried and tested architecture in
the industry.

Then I'll show the modules I've made.

Finally, I'll do a conclusion.
