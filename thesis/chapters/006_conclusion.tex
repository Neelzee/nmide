\section{Making an IDE is hard}

An \gls{ide} has many features, which are needed to enhance the developer
experience. To achieve this, the modular approach enables future users to
enhance the application.

  \input{./figures/text-editor}

  \label{fig:extendedModuleFamily}
\end{figure}

In the figure \ref{fig:extendedModuleFamily}, the \textit{cursor} is the place
at which text is placed when the user writes. If the user clicks someplace in
the document, the cursor \textit{jumps} to that place. If the user uses the
arrow-keys to move around, the cursor moves one character to left or right, or
one line up and down, depending on which arrow-key was pressed.
