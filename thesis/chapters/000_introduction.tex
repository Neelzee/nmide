\chapter{Introduction}

Standard \gls{ide}s are indispensable tools in modern software development,
offering features like early bug reporting, project outline visualization, code
highlighting, and code completion, however, these \gls{ide}s may not adequately
support the unique demands of experimental programming languages. Experimental
languages could introduce new concepts like \gls{asr} Transformation, Term
Algebras, \gls{moa}, \gls{stf}, or other novel programming features. These are
concepts from the academic community, and are not common in \textit{mainstream}
languages, and as such, have little to no support in modern \gls{ide}s. To solve
this, researchers need ad hoc solutions for existing \gls{ide}s, adding the
needed functionality to test out their language features. If this ad hoc
solution is too extreme; outside the standard functionality supported by the
developers of the \gls{ide}, it might be short-lived. As the \gls{ide} is
maintained, updated and improved, the features used to solve the niche needs of
the experimental language might be deprecated.

If, however, the \gls{ide} has integrated support for extending the standard
functionality of the application, then the ad hoc solution will be more stable.
Such a system is known by many names. Plug-in architecture, exstension
\gls{api}, or add-on system, to name a few. The common factor amongst these
systems, is that some component, be it a plug-in, an exstension, an add-on, or a
module, can extend the functionality of the application. This is a modular
approach to extending the lifetime of an application; extending its software
longevity. In many of these systems, these components, are composable,
allowing for multiple components to work together in a modular fashion to add
extra features to an application. This way of adding functionality to an
application is commonly used in \gls{ide}s.


\section{Modular Architecture}

A modular \gls{ide} would assist in this. Even if a new feature from an
experimental language is introduced, it is unlikely that this feature has no
relation to existing features, and as such, it is easier to extend the
application in such a manner to facilitate this new feature, with help of
existing modules. If, however it is the case that this feature is
paradigm-shifting, then there will still be existing functionality that can be
used, re-used or extended to facilitate this.

\begin{hyp} \label{hyp:modular}
  When an application is designed to be modular from the start, then features
  not thought of, by the original developers can be integrated into the
  application, and be stable. If an experimental research language introduces
  some paradigm shifting concept, then this can easily be tested in such a
  modular \gls{ide}.
\end{hyp}

\section{Zero Core Application}

Taking the modular architecture design to the extreme, the core application has
no base features, everything is enabled by an external module. We call such a
highly modular application, a \textit{zero core} application. To qualify for a
\textit{zero core} application, the default application has no functionality;
everything is acquired by modules. Such a design facilitates a modular approach,
enabling a module-developer to only focus on the functionality they want to
extend, not the entire core.

\section{Thesis Outline}

Traditional \gls{ide}s encompass essential features such as syntax highlighting,
code navigation, and hover-help, playing a crucial role in the software 
development process. However, their limitations become apparent when working with
experimental languages. This paper advocates for modularization and
composability as key design principles, demonstrating their ability to extend
the operational lifespan of software by allowing for ease-of adoption to new
paradigms and tools. The discussion revolves around Magnolia, an experimental
research programming language developed by \gls{bldl} at the University of
Bergen. Magnolia will act as a case study illustrating the need for a
specialized \gls{ide}. It is a way to experiment with novel language features.
And to achieve this in a sufficient manner, a more specialized \gls{ide} is
required.

Designing a zero core architecture will be the focus point of this paper, to
develop and implement an modular \gls{ide}. The target language will be Magnolia,
an experimental research language being developed by \gls{bldl} at the University
of Bergen.

In chapter \ref{cha:background}, we will introduce Magonlia, and features this
language introduces that are difficult to encompass using standard \gls{ide}s.
In chapter \ref{cha:ide} we will explore the use case of the afformentioned
\gls{ide}, focusing on the different users of such an application. Chapter
\ref{cha:impl} the design and implementation of the \gls{ide}, mentioning
different designs that were considered, and some challanages that were
encountered.
