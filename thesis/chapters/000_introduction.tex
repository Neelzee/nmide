\chapter{Introduction}

Standard IDEs are indispensable tools in software development, offering features
like early bug reporting, project outline visualization, code highlighting, and
code completion However, these IDEs may not adequately support the unique
demands of experimental programming languages.
% Rewrite this
To solve this, a modular approach is used to designed and IDE.

\section{Experimental Languages}

Talk about Abstract Semantic Representation (ASR) Transformation,
Term Algebras, Mathematics of Arrays, and Syntactic Theory Functor (STF)

\section{Integrated Development Environment}

% TODO: Rewrite this
An Integrated Development Environment, (IDE), aids a developer, as all the
needed tools for development are integrated into one application. There are
different kinds of IDEs, generic and specialized.

A specialized IDE is one targeted towards a specific language, like Eclipse,
(reference?), or IntelliJ (reference?), which target Java/JVM. It contains
specialized features like:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Syntax Highlighting
  \item Code Autocompletion
  \item Go-to-definitions
  \item \dots
\end{itemize}

A lot of these features are possible due to \textit{Language Server Protocols},
which allow for a standardized way for compilers to give code-support to IDE's.

% TODO: Connect these better

A generic IDE contains the features that are common among development in any
programming language, like:

% TODO: Should write a paragraph or two about each of these points
\begin{itemize}
  \item File explorer
  \item Project manager
  \item Version Control System integration
\end{itemize}
