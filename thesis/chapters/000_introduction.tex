\chapter{Introduction}

Standard IDEs are indispensable tools in software development, offering features
like early bug reporting, project outline visualization, code highlighting, and
code completion However, these IDEs may not adequately support the unique
demands of experimental programming languages.
% Rewrite this
In response, this project proposes
a modular IDE designed to extend its lifespan and provide enhanced support for
experimental languages.

\section{Experimental Languages}

Talk about Abstract Semantic Representation (ASR) Transformation,
Term Algebras, Mathematics of Arrays, and Syntactic Theory Functor (STF)

\section{Integrated Development Environment}

What is an IDE?

Why does \textit{normal} IDE's not work for research languages?

\section{Modular Software}
