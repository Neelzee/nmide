\paragraph{Automated Testing} Due to the exstensive modularity of the
application, all modules can be tested individually, by \textit{mocking} the
expected state and events. This means that breaking changes in one module can be
detected before End-To-End testing, which is expensive. \todo{Add source}
But this can only verify the general logic of a module and module family, not
the UI. To achieve such automation, one could rely on an automated testing
framework, like the one in \cite{autoUi}.

\paragraph{\gls{mdcs}} Since the data and the \gls{ui}
in the core application is separated, it allows for use of Multi-way Dataflow
Constraint Systems. Leveraging \gls{mdcs}'s as mentioned in \cite{dslMdcs}
