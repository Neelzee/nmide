\section{Existing module architectures in IDEs}

There exists module architectures in other \gls*{ide}s.


\subsection{Eclipse}

\gls*{ide}s are one of the most common application that supports extensions by
third-party code. \gls*{ide}s like \gls*{eclipse} and \gls*{intellij} are
specialized for working with Java, but they can still support other languages
with the help of modules. A module in \gls*{eclipse} for instance, could extend
\gls*{eclipse} with functionality like syntax highlighting, code completion,
Go-to-definitions, debugging, and more, for standard programming languages.
A lot of this functionality, comes from module-to-module extension, as in
\gls*{eclipse} modules can extend modules, with the use of the \gls*{erpc}~\cite{eclipseRcp}.

\subsubsection{Eclipse Rich Client Platform}
\*gls{erpc} is a platform for building desktop applications. \gls*{eclipse}
being an example of this platform in action. A plug-in could for example be
responsible for setting up the general \gls*{ui} layout, similar to our module,
\textit{ide\_framework}, and another plug-in could then modify this \gls*{ui} by
adding a file explorer, similar to our module \textit{ide\_explorer}.


\subsection{NetBeans}

An important part of NetBeans core architecture, is the NetBeans Module
\gls*{api}. This \gls{api} is responsible for supporting the
\textit{runtime environment}, which is the minimum amount of modules needed to
run the NetBeans application. A module in NetBeans is a JAR file, in which a
module can, amongst other things, list their public packages. This means that
other modules can directly invoke methods provided by this package.


\subsection{IntelliJ}

The extensibility \gls*{intellij} has, is achieved by its extensions points
architecture. This is an \gls*{api} for plugins to integrate with the
\gls*{ide}. Plugins use this \gls*{api} to register their implementations.

\subsection{Visual Studio}

There are two kinds of extensions in Visual Studio, \textit{VSPackage} and
\textit{MEF} extensions. \textit{VSPackage} are mainly used to extend
functionality like tool windows and projects, while \textit{MEF} extensions are
used to customize the text-editor.

\subsection{Visual Studio Code}

\gls*{vscode} is an extensible \gls*{ide}. It achieves this extensibility with
its extension \gls*{api}. This \gls*{api} allows for extensions to modify the
look and behavior of the \gls*{ide}. In fact, many of the core \gls*{ide}
features are possible due to built-in extensions.

\subsection{Emacs}

Emacs\footnote{\url{https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/}} is an extensible text
editor. Almost all of Emacs functionality is achieved by writing code in Emacs
Lisp, a dialect of Lisp\footnote{\url{https://lisp-lang.org/}}. Unlike other
\gls*{ide}s, Emacs does not restrict modules to a certain \gls*{api}, instead
they are free to modify anything, as the functionality from the Emacs Lisp,
\textit{sits} atop of a core written in C, which abstracts away platform
specific code, and enables Emacs to be turned from an a \textit{simple} text
editor, to write and send emails, multimedia management and much more.


\subsection{Theia}

\say{The Theia \gls*{ide} is a modern \gls*{ide} for cloud and desktop built on the Theia Platform}\footnote{\url{https://theia-ide.org/}}.

Eclipse Theia is a highly extensible \gls*{ide}, supporting \textit{extensions}
from \gls*{vscode}, their own extensions and plugins, and \textit{headless}
plugins. Theia differentiates between extensions and plugins, where a
plugin is installed during runtime, and an extension is installed during
compile-time.

Theia reuses components from \gls*{vscode}, like their extensions \gls*{api},
which enables them to support \gls*{vscode} extensions. Theia plugins share
similarities with \gls*{vscode} extensions, but are not restricted to
\textit{just} the \gls*{vscode} \gls*{api}.

Theia's extensions are designed to add or remove existing core functionality in
Theia. They also have access to the entire core \gls*{api}.

An headless plugin runs without access to the frontend, meaning they are suited
for \gls*{cli} interactions, or similar use cases where a frontend is not
needed.

Theia is both a desktop \gls*{ide} and a web \gls*{ide}. Where there is no real
distinction between the two, both abstracting it to a frontend and backend. This
is similar to our zero-core \gls*{ide}, as we can make this abstraction due to
our usage of a web view for the desktop \gls*{ide}.


\section{Multi-way Dataflow Constraint System} \label{sec:mdcs}

One thing this application does not provide a solution for, is the difficulty
in designing good \gls*{gui}. Following the \gls*{mvc}-pattern, \gls*{gui}s can
represent structures such as lists, which users might want to manipulate in
some fashion, like appending or rearranging the items in the list. Managing such
a change, especially one that involves \gls*{gui} widgets can be a challenge,
since a change in the view should be reflected in the model, and encoding this
can be very involved. Luckily, there exists frameworks that make this task
easier. \textit{WarmDrink},~\cite{warmDrink, dslMdcs} is a JavaScript
framework that allow a developer to declarative specify structural changes in
an application. This can be achieved, since the \gls*{ide} exposes a simple
\gls*{api} for runtime systems. A runtime system specifically for a \gls*{mdcs}
could be implemented for JavaScript modules. This could also be done for the
Rust modules, by utilizing the crate developed by Svartveit~\cite{mcdsRust}.
The module developer experience is important, so it's good that there exist
\gls*{mdcs} tooling to ease a module developers experience~\cite{toolMcds}.

Another issue in \gls*{gui}s is optimizing performance in regard to events
triggered by user actions, such as scrolling, resizing or typing. These events
could happen many times in a second, while in theory user speed is trivial for a
computer to keep up with, there are instances where a module family could be
quite large, meaning many different modules are triggered by the same event many
times. There are techniques, called event coalescing, for handling this, like
debouncing and throttling.

\paragraph{Debouncing} Debouncing is a technique where you delay the sending of
an event until after some time period $T$ has passed. Once the event is triggered
$T_0$ starts counting down. If the same event is re-triggered while $T_0 > 0$,
$T_0$ is reset by $T_0 = T$. If $T_0 = 0$, then the event is sent. Ensuring that
$T$ is not too large, is important, as if $T$ is above some threshold, the user
of the \gls*{gui} will notice, and it will make the application \textit{feel}
slow.

\paragraph{Throttling} Throttling is a similar technique to debouncing, except
instead of delaying the event by some time $T$, the event is only sent when
$T_0 = 0$. Meaning the event is sent at regular intervals, and could be sent at
the exact same point in time when the user triggered the event, or it could
happen at most, $T$ units after the user action.

Debouncing and throttling work in less complex \gls*{gui} structures, but as the
amount of features in an application increases, the complexity will also
increase. These event-coalescing-strategies are a source of subtle bugs, as
event coalescing can easily break modularity. In a \gls*{jsms}, this issue could
be solved by using \textit{flushable promises}~\cite{flush}. This could have
solved our issue, where we had some Event handler that took noticeably longer
time to return, but since this was a Rust-Module, we could \textit{solve} this
by doing this computation on another thread. If it was a JavaScript module we
could have solved it by using \textit{flushable promises}.

If we implement a \gls*{ls}-client in JavaScript, \textit{flushable promises}
could allow for a smoother experience, as things like \textit{looking up}
renaming in a Magnolia project is a more involved process for the compiler,
and in larger projects, could take a noticeably long time.


\section{Automated testing}

Due to the extensive modularity of the application, all modules can be tested
individually, by \textit{mocking} the expected state and events. This means that
breaking changes in one module can be detected before \gls*{e2e} testing, which
is expensive. But this can only verify the general logic of a module and module
family, not the UI. To achieve such automation, one could rely on an automated
testing framework, like the one in~\cite{autoUi}. Or if one is working with a
\textit{simple} JavaScript runtime, one could use third party software like
\textit{Playwright} for creating tests, as it can auto generate the \gls*{dsl},
while the developer uses the module or entire \gls*{ide} if it is an \gls*{e2e}
test. This would help a module developer to discover behavior that a user might
not expect~\cite{leastGui}.


\section{Syntactic Theory Functor}

\gls*{stf} is a framework for creating, reusing and restructuring
specifications\cite{stf:haveraaen:2020}, specifications from algebraic
specification languages like CafeOBJ~\cite{cafeObj}. \gls*{stf}s are also used
by the new Magnolia compiler\footnote{As of May 2025, still in development}, to
resolve renaming in Magnolia and \textit{flattening} of the \gls*{asr} to be
shown to the developer \cite{wiig}.


\section{Abstract algebra}

Magnolia is a kind of algebraic specification language, like CafeOBJ~\cite{cafeObj}.
An algebraic specification language, is a language where one can develop
similarly as to how one might create an algebraic structure. As shown in the
development of this \gls*{ide}, this can be quite useful way of thinking.


\section{Language workbenches}

Language workbenches are environments for simplifying the creation and use of
computer languages~\cite{lwb}.


\section{Language Server}

The most important features in a modern \gls*{ide} are possible due to the
\gls*{lsp}. \gls*{lsp} is a protocol for a language server and editor,
(the client), in which they communicate, allowing for many of the features
mentioned in section \ref{sec:ide}, and explicitly mentioned in table
\ref{tbl:ide}. \gls*{lsp} being the standard since the 2020s, is a sign of
modularity being preferred, as now a single \gls*{lsp} can be created, and used
across several different applications, like IntelliJ, VS Code and \gls*{vim}.
While useful for \textit{standard} language, this is the limiting factor when it
comes to supporting experimental languages, as not only does a new set of
protocols need to be appended to a language server, the editor itself needs to
be changed to actually use these protocols. This creates a lot of work, for both
the \gls*{ide} developer and for the compiler developer. Here is where a modular
approach can help both. If some new functionality or feature is added to the
experimental language, this off course means the compiler/interpreter has to be
expanded and/or modified, but for the \gls*{ide}, a module could be added and/or
modified to utilize this change, instead of having to change the entire
application.

\begin{table}[]
  \centering
  \caption{\gls*{ide} features enabled by \gls*{lsp}}
  \label{tbl:ide}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    IDE Feature & \gls*{lsp}-method \\ \hline
    Go to Declaration & textDocument/definition \\ \hline
    Go to Implementation & textDocument/implementation \\ \hline
    Auto-completion & textDocument/completion \\ \hline
    Hover & textDocument/hover \\ \hline
    Warnings & textDocument/publishDiagnostics \\ \hline
    Rename & textDocument/rename \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

An example of this in action, say a developer is working on a file
\textit{main.ts}, in their Typescript project. They hover over a type imported
from, and defined in \textit{types.ts}. This is what happens:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The editor detects the user is hovering over a \textit{special} word
  \item The editor sends a request to the Typescript \gls*{ls}
  \item The \gls*{ls} responds
  \item The editor formats the response into a small window showcasing the
    documentation and implementation of the type
\end{enumerate}
