\section{FAFO}

To research the earlier mentioned questions, the \textit{FAFO} method was used.
I \textbf{Fucked Around}, and I \textbf{Found Out}. The first part will be explored in chapter 4,
while the last part will be explored in chapter 5 and 6.


\section{Modules}

As a part of this project, these plugins will be implemented to verify the
functionality of the modularization of the IDE.
