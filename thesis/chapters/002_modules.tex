\section{Modules}

The proposed modular IDE includes specific modules tailored for experimental
languages, such as ASR Transformation, Term Algebras, MoA translation, and STF.
As a part of this project, these plugins will be implemented to verify the
functionality of the modularization of the IDE.

\subsection{Abstract Semantic Representation Transformation}

The ASR of a language, is an extension of a normal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST),
but with extra information. This representation of the syntax is handy when
developing. Specifically for Magnolia, the interest is in the transformation of
this ASR; the flattened version.
