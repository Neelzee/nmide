\chapter{Future Work}

Would've, could've, should've.


\section{Technical Debt}

It just piles and piles and piles on.

\section{Modular Language Server}

Once the compiler \cite{wiig} is implemented, a proper \gls{ls} can be created.

\section{Modular Editor}

The prototype editor module develop for this \gls{ide} is subpar compared to
existing ones. A new one should be developed, in tandem with a \gls{ls} client.
This will ensure that this \gls{ide} can support more languages.
