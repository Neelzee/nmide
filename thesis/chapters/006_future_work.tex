\chapter{Future Work}

Would've, could've, should've.


\section{Technical Debt}

It just piles and piles and piles on.

\subsection{Module Market}

No module market. How should we distribute modules?

\subsection{Testing}

No unit tests for the TypeScript side, no integration testing between the
frontend and backend.

\subsection{Attribute and Instructions}

Can't remove or change eventListeners currently. This is because to remove an
EventListener, the exact same function passed to the \textit{addEventListener}
must be used, which means a reference to this function needs to be stored, but
having two or more of the same type? It can get confusing for a module developer
of what should actually happen.

\section{Modular Language Server}

Once the compiler \cite{wiig} is implemented, a proper \gls{ls} can be created.

\section{Modular Editor}

The prototype editor module develop for this \gls{ide} is subpar compared to
existing ones. A new one should be developed, in tandem with a \gls{ls} client.
This will ensure that this \gls{ide} can support more languages.
