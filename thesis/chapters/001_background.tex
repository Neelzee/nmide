\section{Magnolia}

Magnolia is an experimental research language being developed \gls{bldl} at the
University of Bergen. Magnolia is designed to support a high level of
abstraction and ease of reasoning. This is achieved by \textit{concepts},
\textit{axioms}, \textit{implementations}, and \textit{satisfaction}.

\subsection{Magnolia Concept}

A concept in Magnolia is an \gls{api}. Commonly, the term \gls{api} is used
specifically for \gls{rest} \gls{api}s, but it also covers concepts, like in
Magnolia, interfaces in Java, traits in Rust, or type-classes in Haskell. What
all of these variations have in common, is that they specify a method for two
different procedures to communicate with each other.  In a \gls{rest} \gls{api}
this could be a microservice architecture, where several servers send and
receive requests and responses, or in a programming project, it could be the
\textbf{List} interface in Java, which informs implementers of that interface,
which methods are needed to qualify as a \textbf{List}. In Magnolia a concept
concepts declare types, functions and properties which those functions need to
uphold. A simple example of this would be a concept for addition with natural numbers.

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={Natural numbers (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:nat
    ]{./code/magnolia-nat.mg}
\end{center}

In the listing \ref{lst:nat}, we are specifying concept called
\textit{NaturalNumbers}, which declares a type \textbf{N}, and three methods
that act upon the type \textbf{N}. We have the function, (also called a
constructor), \textbf{zero}, which takes zero arguments, and should return
something of type \textbf{N}. With this constructor, we can instantiate our
numbers. To get new numbers, we have the function \textbf{succ}, which should
give the \textit{succ}essor to the passed number. That way, we can represent $0$
as \textbf{zero()}, $1$ as \textbf{succ(zero())}, and $2$ as
\textbf{succ(succ(zero()))}. The final function, is an infix operator. $+$ takes
two arguments, of type \textbf{N}, and returns an \textbf{N}. Of course, this
should be interpreted as addution, meaning \textbf{succ(zero())} $+$
\textbf{succ(succ(zero()))} $=$ \textbf{succ(succ(succ(zero())))}, or using
numbers: $1 + 2 = 3$. Finally, the last statement in the concept, is an axiom,
stating that given any $a$, if we add \textbf{zero()} to $a$, we should get $a$.

This axiom is what allows for us to put constraints on our concepts, which
allows for improvement in our \gls{api}. Unlike other \gls{api}s, like traits or
\gls{rest}, such specific constraints can only be achieved by using unit tests,
which is not enforced on the implementor. But with axioms, this is possible in
Magnolia. This pattern is quite useful, since it allows for \textit{reuse} of
logic. The listings \ref{lst:list} specifies a list interface, we can
instantiate a list, and do operations on it, like getting adding an element to
the list, or by concatenating two lists. We can also fetch the first element of
the list, by using \textbf{head}, note the \textit{guard} attached to the
function statement, this guard ensures that when this method is invoked, the
list we get the first element from, cannot be empty, (equal to \textbf{nil()}),
this means that our function is not \textit{total}, but \textit{partial}. This
means that for any argument, we might not have a corresponding result. If we did
not have this guard, then what would happen if we \textit{took} \textbf{head} of a list
with no elements? In languages like Java, we would get null, but this does not
exist in Magnolia. We could expand upon the list \gls{api} by creating a
non-empty variant of list, as shown in \ref{lst:nonList}, which is the same as
list, except to instantiate it, we need to supply an element, ensuring when we
have a \textbf{NonEmptyList} variant, we can safely get an element from it,
since there will at minimum, be one element in the list.

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={List concept (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:list
    ]{./code/magnolia-list.mg}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={NonEmptyList concept (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:nonList
    ]{./code/magnolia-non-list.mg}
\end{center}

However, this interpretation depends on our implementation of the concept.

\subsection{Magnolia Implementation}

As one can see in listing \ref{lst:impl}, we have implemented the concept
specified in \ref{lst:nat}, by using concrete values for \textbf{N}. There is an
implementation for all the functions, giving us the functionality we set out to
specify with our concept, but there is nothing stopping us from straying away
from the specification, by implementing it incorrectly. As can be seen in
listing \ref{lst:impl-wrong}.

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={Natural numbers implementation (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:impl
    ]{./code/magnolia-add.mg}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={Invalid implementation (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:impl-wrong
    ]{./code/magnolia-add-wrong.mg}
\end{center}

Here we have implemented our addiction operator in such a way, where it breaks
our axiom. This is where the \textit{satisfaction} comes in, it is what ties the
concept and implementation together, by ensuring our axiom are upheld.

\subsection{Magnolia Satisfaction}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={Satisfaction of the natural numbers (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:sat
    ]{./code/magnolia-sat.mg}
\end{center}

When implementing a concept in Magnolia, one could do so incorrectly. In other
programming languages, one might still have \textit{encoded} some meaning in an
interface, like that in the interface \textbf{Action} in listing
\ref{lst:jeditor}, is an associative operation. To detect this, one would have
to create a unit test for each implementation of the interface, while in
Magnolia one writes a satisfaction as shown in listing \ref{lst:sat}, which in
turn is \textit{transpiled} to a format understandable by an \gls{smt} solver.

\subsubsection{Satisfiability Modulo Theories solvers}

An \gls{smt} solver is a program that takes our implementation, and say whether
our implementations satisfies our concept. In \cite{beateVerification}, Skogvik 
lays out different \gls{smt} solvers and compare them against each other, with
the Magnolia library as input. One of Skogviks conclusions are that while
verification of some program is good to have, some features needed for a new
\gls{ide} would be to integrate it with this functionality.


\subsection{Mathematics and Programming}

Mathematics is everywhere, and useful. It's not always easy to notice this, but
one thing that helps, is knowing the names of the concepts one encounter. One
can easily understand that knowing simple operations like addition,
multiplication, etc. is useful but for more abstract mathematics, this is
harder. An example of this is abstract algebra, which is the study of algebraic
structures, which are structures that are very common in programming. A
programmer will use these structures more often than not, knowingly or
unknowingly, and a good programmer will explicitly seek these structures out.

An important aspect of development, is logging. Knowing what actions have taken
place is an essential tool when hunting down bugs. A common way to structure
logs, would be composing logs, depending on when they occurred. As a concrete
example, let's say we are making a text editor, and are in the need of a logging
manager, which, among other things, should compose different log statements.
Assuming we have some type \textbf{Log(A)}, where there the type \textbf{A}, is the
result of the computation a given function, we want to be able to compose
different, related, computations. But, importantly, the order of composition
of the \textbf{Log(A)}-type matters. Representing the composition of the
\textbf{Log(A)}-type as $\odot$, doing, and letting $a, b, c$ be of type
\textbf{Log A}:

\begin{definition}[Log Composition] \label{def:logComp}
  \begin{equation}
    a \odot \left ( b \odot c \right ) = \left ( a \odot b \right ) \odot c
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

Now we have a good logger, as the logs of the entire call stack is available for
us to read when something goes wrong. Moving on, a good feature of a text
editor, is being able to undo and redo actions. These are the actions that a
user can do:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Insert text at a position
  \item Delete text from a position
  \item Redo an action
  \item Undo an action
\end{itemize}

Same as in the logging example, composing is a reasonable thing to implement,
and should result in another action. Similarly, the order matters; deleting text
and then inserting, is not the same as inserting and then deleting. But what is
different, is that we also want the \textit{inverse} of an action, so for every
action we want an opposite action that undos an action. Then our composition of
actions looks different. Say, $a$ is some action, and $c$ is some opposite
action, then our composition looks like this:

\begin{definition}[Action Composition] \label{def:actComp}
  \begin{equation}
    a \odot c = U
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

Where $U$ is an action representing \textit{no-operation}. This could be
inserting the empty string at any position, deleting the empty string at any
position, or redoing or undoing any of the aforementioned actions.

Both of these examples are relatively easy to implement, but harder to verify,
to satisfy our properties; that the \textit{logic} holds. In Java and Rust, to
ensue that we have implemented something correctly, one would create a unit
test. But there is nothing to ensure that we create this test correctly, that
we cover all the edge cases, or if we are testing the correct thing.

\subsection{Logging example in Java, Rust, and Magnolia}

In the Java listing (\ref{lst:jlogging}) and Rust listing (\ref:rlogging) we
have implementations which might not uphold our constraints. We can add unit
tests, that ensure the implementations satisfy the definition \ref{def:logComp},
but this safeguard only exists in our project, and once our \gls{api} can be
implemented by third-party developers, we have no guarantee they will follow our
constraints.

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Java
    , caption={Logging structure (Java)}
    , label=lst:jlogging]{./code/logging.java}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Rust
    , caption={Logging structure (Rust)}
    , label=lst:rlogging]{./code/logging.rs}
\end{center}

In Magnolia, however, it is possible. In the \ref{lst:mlogging} listing, we can
add an axiom, which is the same as our requirement definition
\ref{def:actComp}. For implementers, \textit{consumers} of our \gls{api}, we
can now ensure they implement correctly, as long as they add the simple
declaration showed in listing \ref{lst:mlogSat}. This will be ensured, because
in a standard Magnolia work routine, a developer will invoke an \gls{smt}
solver, which will ensure the concepts, and the implementations implementing
concepts are sound; that they are satisfiable.

\begin{center}

    , label=lst:mlogging]{./code/logging.mg}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={Magnolia logging satisfaction}
    , label=lst:mlogSat]{./code/logging-sat.mg}
\end{center}

\subsection{Editor example in Java, Rust, and Magnolia}

The Java and Rust listings, (\ref{lst:jeditor}, \ref{lst:reditor}), also have no
method of ensuring the satisfiability of future implementations. But what is
more interesting, is that we can see, clearily in the case of the Magnolia
listing \ref{lst:meditor}, that there is some kind of relation between these
\gls{api}s.

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Java
    , caption={Editor structure (Java)}
    , label=lst:jeditor]{./code/editor.java}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Rust
    , caption={Editor structure (Rust)}
    , label=lst:reditor]{./code/editor.rs}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={Editor structure (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:meditor]{./code/editor.mg}
\end{center}

Both the logging example, and the text editor example, are some binary operation
over some set. In the first example, our set was all different log statements of
the type \textbf{Log A}, and composing these logs, gave us another
\textbf{Log A} type. While in the second example, we were working on the set of
actions, which we could compose, which also gave us another action, but we also
had an action representing no-operation, and an \textit{inverse} operation,
undoing an action. This is related to mathematics, specifically abstract
algebra, the study of algebraic structures.

\subsection{Abstract Algebra}

In the first example, we are working with a \textit{semigroup}, and in the
second example, we are working with a \textit{group}. These are known as
algebraic structures, which is just some set, with a binary operation, and some
property on that binary operation. The trivial example, is known as
\textit{magma}, and is defined by \ref{def:magma}. The closure \ref{def:closed}
simply specifies that we only work with one set.

\begin{definition}[Closure] \label{def:closed}
  For a set $M$, with a binary operation $\oplus$,
  $\forall a, \forall b, \exists c \in M$, such that
  $a \oplus b = c$.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Closure} Addition with the integers, ($\mathbb{Z}$), is a kind of
  closure, as per the definition \ref{def:closed}, since no matter what integer
  you put into the equation, you will still get a positive integer. And since
  this is the only requirement a magma has, this example is also a magma.

\begin{definition}[Magma] \label{def:magma}
  A magma is a set $M$, with a binary operation $\oplus$, which is
  \textit{closed} by definition \ref{def:closed}
\end{definition}

We can \textit{extend} the definition of magma, by adding associativity on the
binary operation. The definition \ref{def:assoc}, as shown in the examples,
simply specifies that the order we evaluate our composition matters.

\begin{definition}[Associativity Law] \label{def:assoc}
  For any binary operation $\oplus$, on a set $M$, $a, b, c \in M$.
  $a \oplus \left ( b \oplus c \right ) = \left ( a \oplus b \right ) \oplus c$,
  must hold.
\end{definition}

This associativity gives us a semigroup, as shown in the definition
\ref{def:semi}, which is the structure that we modeled in our logging example.

\begin{definition}[Semigroup] \label{def:semi}
  A semigroup is a set $M$, with a binary operation $\oplus$, and $\oplus$ must
  uphold the definitions \ref{def:closed} and \ref{def:assoc}.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Semigroup} Multiplication with the positive integers, ($\mathbb{N}$), is
  associative, since no matter where we put parentheses; what order we
  evaluate this equation: $2 * 3 * 4$, we will get the same answer.

By simply requiring the identity law (\ref{def:ident}), we get a
monoid (\ref{def:monoid}), and adding the inverse law
(\ref{def:inv}), we get a group.

\begin{definition}[Identity Law] \label{def:ident}
  For any binary operation $\oplus$, on a set $M$,
  $\forall a, \exists U \in M$, such that
  $a \oplus U = a$, and $U$ is unique.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Monoid] \label{def:monoid}
  A monoid is a set $M$, with a binary operation $\oplus$, and $\oplus$ must
  uphold the definitions \ref{def:closed}, \ref{def:assoc}, and \ref{def:ident}.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Monoid} To make a monoid, we can choose the binary operation to be
  $\times$, and our set to be the natural numbers, ($\mathbb{N}$). We know addition
  is closed, and associative, so choosing $U = 1$, we get a monoid. Any number
  from our set $\mathbb{N}$ multiplied with $1$, gives us the number we choose.

\begin{definition}[Inverse Law] \label{def:inv}
  For any binary operation $\oplus$, on a set $M$,
  $\forall a, \exists U \in M$, such that
  $a \oplus U = a$, and $U$ is unique.
  And $\forall a, \exists b \in M$, such that $a \oplus b = U$, and the mapping
  for $a \to b$ is one-to-one.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Group] \label{def:group}
  A group is a set $M$, with a binary operation $\oplus$, and $\oplus$ must
  uphold the definitions \ref{def:closed}, \ref{def:assoc}, \ref{def:ident},
  and \ref{def:inv}.
\end{definition}

The definition \ref{def:group}, of course is identical to the structure we used
to model undo-redo, in our text editor example. To avoid common mistakes when
implementing these structures, it would behoove a developer if they could encode
these properties in something like an interface or a trait, however, this is not
possible in either Java nor Rust. We cannot enforce things like the definition
\ref{def:assoc} on our operators.

\subsection{Java: Magma to Group}

This structure not could be implemented in something like Java, an
Object-Oriented Language, as shown in listings \ref{lst:jmagma},
\ref{lst:jsemigroup}, \ref{lst:jmonoid}, and \ref{lst:jgroup}. Note the empty
interfaces; there is nothing that enforces the different laws on the properties.
This can only be done by unit testing, which is not enforced on a consumer of
the \gls{api}.

    [ language=Java
    , caption={Magma concept (Java)}
    , label=lst:jmagma]{./code/magma.java}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Java
    , caption={Semigroup concept (Java)}
    , label=lst:jsemigroup]{./code/semigroup.java}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting

    , label=lst:jmonoid]{./code/monoid.java}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Java
    , caption={Group concept (Java)}
    , label=lst:jgroup]{./code/group.java}
\end{center}

\subsection{Rust: Magma to Group}

The same issue with property enforcement exists in Rust.

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Rust
    , caption={Magma (Rust)}
    , label=lst:rmagma]{./code/magma.rs}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Rust
    , caption={Semigroup (Rust)}
    , label=lst:rsemigroup]{./code/semigroup.rs}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Rust
    , caption={Monoid (Rust)}
    , label=lst:rmonoid]{./code/monoid.rs}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Rust
    , caption={Group (Rust)}
    , label=lst:rgroup]{./code/group.rs}
\end{center}

\subsection{Magnolia: Magma to Group}

In Magnolia, however, this can be required on the \textit{interface}-level. The
example code shown in listing \ref{lst:magma}, showcases a concept
representation a binary operation, which has one function, \textit{binop}, which
takes in two values of type \textit{T}, and returns \textit{T}. Note that the
actual implementation of this function is missing. This is because a concept
encodes the properties of a users code. The actual implementation of the
binary function needs to uphold the properties of the concept that is
being implemented. Note that this is unlike the Java and Rust example, in
which we have no way to encode the property of our binary function. So any
consumer of our \gls{api} would not be explicitly bound to our restriction of
the associativity law \ref{def:assoc}, identify law \ref{def:ident}, and the
inverse law \ref{def:inv}, required by semigroup and group. The closure
definition, \ref{def:closed}, however, can be encoded by the type system in Java
and Rust.

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={Magma (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:magma]{./code/magma.mg}
\end{center}

In the example code shown in listing \ref{lst:semigroup}, the \textit{magma}
concept has been expanded upon, still following the same rules as before, but
with the added property of associativity.

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={Semigroup (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:semigroup]{./code/semigroup.mg}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={Monoid (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:monoid]{./code/monoid.mg}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={Group (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:group]{./code/group.mg}
\end{center}

So Magnolia facilitates reuse, and extension of logic. In Magnolia we can build
upon existing proven algebraic structures like a group, and reuse their
properties. For example, with the editor example, we can do optimizations on
the actions. Since the user of the editor reacts slower than our code, we can
batch several actions together, and evaluate them together. If the user keeps
writing and deleting the same sentence over and over again, we could evaluate
them as an "NoOp", and not do the expensive IO operation.

\section{Reusable Software}

One of the most important features in any programming language, is the notion
of \textit{reusability}. From the invention of the GO-TO-statement, with which
we could repeat code statements $N$ times instead of writing them $N$ times, to
functions, where we could run the same piece of code several times in a
program, with different inputs, reuse has been an essential tool for a
programmer. It avoids \textit{re-inventing the wheel}, as common functionality
can be externalized and reused in several different places. This ensures
fewer points of failure. Instead of having to test several different places in
a project, we can test the function being used different places.

\subsection{Reuse in Magnolia}

Reusability is also an important feature in Magnolia, but this reusability is in
the entire language. In libraries in other languages, functions are reused, in
an attempt to avoid common logical mistakes, but these mistakes could still be
there, hiding in plain view. In Magnolia, one can re-use the \textit{logic} of a
function. The logging and group example can be rewritten using Magnolia concepts
as shown in listing \ref{lst:logging} and \ref{lst:editor} respectively, by
reusing the concepts we created for semigroup in listing \ref{lst:semigroup} and group
in listing \ref{lst:group}.

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={Logging example (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:logging]{./code/logging-solution.mg}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={Editor example (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:editor]{./code/editor-solution.mg}
\end{center}

Indeed, reuse is so useful, that in Magnolia one can rename concepts one use.
In the listings \ref{lst:logging} and \ref{lst:editor}, we have renamed the type
and function into something that makes more sense in the specific use case.
While it is useful for us developing the concept, to know that our logging
concept is a semigroup, when using an implementation, this is less relevant.

\subsection{Software Longevity}

Most examples of \textit{popular} software, are open source, like \gls{vim}.
\gls{vim} is a text editor which has been in use since 1991. There are several
factors behind this success, but the ones being highlighted here, are due to its
extensibility and due to it being open-sourced. Being open sourced, allows for a
rotating cast of maintainers, ensuring the core application has the features its
users wants. The users of \gls{vim} can be split into two categories,
\textit{standard users}, and \textit{module developers}. \gls{vim} has an
extensive module ecosystem, which can extend \gls{vim}s functionality from a
text editor, to a fully fledged \gls{ide}.

\todo{Mention Eclipse and IntelliJ here as well?}

\subsection{Modularity in software}

\todo{Is configuration a form of modularization?}

\section{Integrated Development Environment} \label{sec:ide}
\todo{Turn each paragraph into a subsection?}

An \gls{ide}, aids a developer, as all the needed tools for development are
\todo{Mention the tools, and how devs had it before.}
integrated into one application. There are two different kinds of \gls{ide}s,
generic and specialized.

A specialized \gls{ide} is one targeted towards a specific language, like
Eclipse, (reference?), or IntelliJ (reference?), which target Java/JVM. It
contains specialized features like the following:
\todo{
  Rewrite this because Eclipse, while generic, has plugin support which, allows
  it to support different languages, as does IntelliJ.
}

\subsection{Syntax Highlighting}

Highlighting important keywords, identifiers and more, makes the language easier
to read for the developer, allowing them to spot easy to miss errors, like
misspelling of keywords, functions, and variables. In the pictures
\ref{pic:stx}, and \ref{pic:noStx} we can see the difference between having
syntax highlighting. In \ref{pic:stx} we can clearly see what is, and is not a
latex command, if we wrote \textit{\\begn} instead of \textit{\\begin}, we can
notice the discrepancy, as we expect it to, in this case, be purple. We are
using visualization to make developers notice issues.

\begin{figure} \label{pic:stx}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{syntax-highlighting.png}
  \caption{Syntax Highlighting (\LaTeX\ in \gls{nvim})}
\end{figure}

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{no-syntax-highlighting.png}
  \caption{No Syntax Highlighting (\LaTeX\ in \gls{nvim})}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Code Autocompletion}

Suggesting keywords, method names or even entire code snippets, is a powerful
tool an \gls{ide} can have. This is possible to achieve, in some form, without
being specialized, by for example, suggesting text that already exist in the
document, but is most useful if it is specialized, and can suggest built-in
methods. This allows a developer to not having to remember exactly how methods
are named, is the method to split a string by some delimiter, \textit{split\_by}
or \textit{split\_on}? As long as the developer writes \textit{split}, the
correct method name will be suggested.

\begin{figure} \label{pic:completion}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{context-completion.png}
  \caption{\gls{vscode} suggesting appropriate methods (Rust)}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Go-To-Definitions}
Being able to quickly navigate to methods and read their implementation is a
useful tool for a developer, as less time has to be spent navigating the project
structure, to figure out where some method was implemented, and more time can be
spent actually developing.

\subsection{Pretty Printing/Formatting}
Following the languages style guide.
\todo{Expand, add examples like with Rust}

\subsection{Boilerplate Code Generation}
For unit tests, getters and setters, (where relevant), and similar.

\begin{figure} \label{pic:generate}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{generate.png}
  \caption{Window for generating boilerplate code for a unit test (Kotlin in \gls{intellij})}
\end{figure}

These are features also within a generic \gls{ide}, but most are available
through the \gls{ide} module architecture. A generic \gls{ide} contains the
features that are common among development across any programming language. But
the following features are not exclusive to generic \gls{ide}s.

\subsection{File Explorer}

Most project nowadays is larger than one file, so being able to visualize the
project in a tree-like-structure, and navigate that, is useful. This feature
usually comes with the ability to manipulate the project structure, by adding
files, folders, moving files around, and deleting them.

\subsection{Version Control System Integration}

\gls{vcs} is an integral part of development. Being able to sync ones work
between different machines and developers is essential.

\subsection{Integrated Terminal}

An \gls{ide} is an all-encompassing tool for development related work, which
includes a terminal.

\subsection{Module Market \& Installation}

An important part of the user experience in a modular \gls{ide}, is being able
to seamlessly add, install and use modules. An integral part of this is the
module marketplace. This is a term for the place where a user can find modules,
and with the click of a button, install them. Depending on what feature this
module adds, the installation process could be as simple as adding it during the
runtime, or if it's a more complex or integrated feature to the \gls{ide},
requires a restart of the \gls{ide}.

\section{Module Architecture}

A modular application, is an application which can be extended by other pieces
of software. This extensibility is useful as features that the original
developers of the application did not think about, can be added. If this module
architecture is well-designed, then this extension can be added without changing
the core application.

There are different ways an application can be extended. The most common one
uses so-called \textit{live-reload}, in which, if a module drastic changes the
functionality of an application, the application has to be restarted, or if it
is a \textit{minor} change, the module is simply loaded. This method is
extending the application during runtime, which is the method most users
expect. Another method would be \textit{compile-time-extension}, in which
modules are added before the application itself is compiled. There are some
advantages and disadvantage in both approaches.

\subsection{Compile Time Module}

As an example, a standard user of any application will expect the application to
come bundled with all the needed functionality. This is best achieved with the
\textit{compile-time-extension} method, since the application can be installed
with the expected modules.
\todo{Maybe mention it could be faster due to compiler optimalization?}

\subsection{Runtime Module}

Runtime modules are usually also interpreted, but they can still be a
library, same as in a compile time module.

\subsection{Modular Architecture in IDEs}

\gls{ide}s are one of the most common application that supports extensions by
third-party code. \gls{ide}s like \gls{eclipse} and \gls{intellij} are
specialized for working with Java, but they can still support other languages
with the help of modules. A module (called plug-in in \gls{eclipse}),
\gls{eclipse} can be extended with functionality like syntax highlighting, code
completion, Go-to-definitions, debugging, and more, for standard programming
languages. A lot of this functionality, comes from module-to-module extension,
as in \gls{eclipse} modules can extend modules, with the use of the Eclipse Rich
Client Platform \cite{eclipseRcp}.

\subsection{Module Ecosystem}

In modern \gls{ide}s, with an extensive module architecture, there exists a
vast module ecosystem. From simple modules that change the color scheme, or
add file icons to more complex modules that add support for other languages.
A good variety of a module ecosystem can help ensure the longevity of an
\gls{ide}. In the table \ref{tbl:mod}, we can see that \gls{ide}s have an
extensive module ecosystem. \footnotemark

\footnotetext{Data found by looking at the marketplace\footnotemark for the modules, in order:\url{https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/welcome-eclipse-marketplace}, \url{https://plugins.jetbrains.com/}, \url{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode\&category=All\%20categories\&sortBy=Installs}}

\gls{vscode} is the popular \gls{ide} \cite{topIde}, and this could be due to
the amount of modules it has to offer. The amount of modules attributed to
\gls{vscode} could be the cause of a positive feedback loop. \gls{vscode} is
popular because it has many modules to extend the functionality, making it able
to cover many use cases. Since \gls{vscode} is popular, developers use, and make
modules for \gls{vscode}. All of which strengthen the longevity of the
\gls{ide}.

\begin{table}[]
  \centering
  \caption{Module Ecosystem per \gls{ide}}
  \label{tbl:mod}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    \gls{ide} & Module count \\ \hline
    Eclipse & $\sim1200$ \\ \hline
    IntelliJ & $\sim9500$ \\ \hline
    VS Code & $\sim71700$ \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Module Marketplace}

Having modules is all well and good, but if a user cannot not easily get the
module, it's not useful. The top \gls{ide}s mentioned, \gls{eclipse},
\gls{intellij}, and \gls{vscode} all have access to their respective
\textit{module marketplace}, a dedicated webpage to find modules, integrated
into the application. This is the most user-friendly method for a user to search
for and find modules, as they can simply do a keyword search for the language
they are wanting support for, say Haskell, and get the necessary modules
available to use with a simple click of a button.

\subsection{Granularity}

When designing modules, the \textit{granularity} of the combined modules has to
be considered. As an example, if one where to extend the zero-core application
with the needed functionality for it to be considered an \gls{ide}, this could be
achieved by creating a singular module which does all the work. However, this
is not a modular approach, as if one wants to change some specific feature in
the \gls{ide}-module, one would have to re-create the whole module with that
specific feature implemented. Instead, if this functionality was granular,
that is to say, split into several modules, that together enable the needed
features, then it would be \textit{simpler} to modify the needed modules to
achieve the wanted feature.


\subsection{Module Family}

A module family are several modules enabling a single
\textit{feature}. A user of the \gls{ide} might think that being able to browse
the project using a file explorer integrated into the \gls{ide} as a single
feature, in a modular system, that facilitates reuse, this would be made up of
several different modules.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{./figures/text-editor-simple}
  \caption{Text Editor Module Family}
  \label{fig:textEditorSimple}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:textEditorSimple}, an input file is parsed to some structure
which is used to translate user actions, into cursor movements. The cursor being
the place in the file where text is written to by the user.

This is a feature that naturally shows up in a \textit{true} modular system. If
several modules together enable some feature, then those modules can be treated
as a singular module by an external module developer, depending on what they
want to extend.


\section{Language Workbench}

Language workbenches are environments for simplifying the creation and use of
computer languages. \cite{lwb}

\todo{Expand}

\section{Language Server}

The most important features in a modern \gls{ide} are possible due to the
\gls{lsp}. \gls{lsp} is a protocol for a language server and editor,
(the client), with which they communicate, allowing for many of the features
mentioned in section \ref{sec:ide}, and explicitly mentioned in table
\ref{tbl:ide}. \gls{lsp} being the standard since the 2020s, is a sign of
modularity being preferred, as now a single \gls{lsp} can be created, and used
across several different applications, like IntelliJ, VS Code and \gls{vim}.
While useful for \textit{standard} language, this is the limiting factor when it
comes to supporting experimental languages, as not only does a new set of
protocols need to be appended to a language server, the editor itself needs to
be changed to actually use these protocols. This creates a lot of work, for both
the \gls{ide} developer and for the compiler developer. Here is where a modular
approach can help both. If some new functionality or feature is added to the
experimental language, this off course means the compiler/interpreter has to be
expanded and/or modified, but for the \gls{ide}, a module could be added and/or
modified to utilize this change, instead of having to change the entire
application.

\begin{table}[]
  \centering
  \caption{\gls{ide} features enabled by \gls{lsp}}
  \label{tbl:ide}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    IDE Feature & \gls{lsp}-method \\ \hline
    Go to Declaration & textDocument/definition \\ \hline
    Go to Implementation & textDocument/implementation \\ \hline
    Auto-completion & textDocument/completion \\ \hline
    Hover & textDocument/hover \\ \hline
    Warnings & textDocument/publishDiagnostics \\ \hline
    Rename & textDocument/rename \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

An example of this in action, say a developer is working on a file
\textit{main.ts}, in their Typescript project. They hover over a type imported
from, and defined in \textit{types.ts}. This is what happens:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The editor detects the user is hovering over a \textit{special} word
  \item The editor sends a request to the Typescript \gls{ls}
  \item The \gls{ls} responds
  \item The editor formats the response into a small window showcasing the
    documentation and implementation of the type
\end{enumerate}

\section{Existing Magnolia IDE}

The current \gls{ide} for Magnolia \cite{baggeIde}, is a many-years-old version
of Eclipse, using modules and functionality from the core Eclipse application,
that has since been outdated. The \gls{ide}s lifetime was limited by a
dependency on external modules and features that where not maintained by the
\gls{ide}-developers. This meant that for future development of Magnolia, an
outdated \gls{ide} was needed, with outdated tooling. Furthermore, the Magnolia
\todo{This could be its own section, maybe?}
compiler was implemented as an Eclipse module, which means that development is
limited to Eclipse, and only Eclipse, as a developer cannot compile Magnolia
code without it.

Modularization will help to mitigate some of the issues with the current
Magnolia \gls{ide}. Instead of maintaining an entire application, the needed and
wanted features of the application can be maintained instead.

Experimental languages might have features which are not possible to be fully
used in current \gls{ide}s. This is also the case for the current Magnolia
\gls{ide}. The compiler for Magnolia, syntax highlighting, error reporting, and
hover-functionality are functionality made in the Eclipse \gls{ide}, by using
its plug-in architecture. Some of the functionality and plug-ins this
implementation used, have been deprecated in later version of Eclipse. This
means the Magnolia \gls{ide} is locked to an old version of Eclipse, which, as
time passes, increases the complexity of installation, as the surrounding
tooling and libraries needed by this version of Eclipse also becomes deprecated.
Currently, in INF220, at the university, two weeks are set aside for students to
be able to install it.

\section{Challenges imposed by Magnolia}

In most programming languages, any type has a singular definition, so invoking
the \textit{go-to-definition} endpoint implemented by an \gls{lsp} results in a
singular response. The actual response of the \gls{lsp} is a list, but this is
\textit{always} a singleton. However, in Magnolia a singular type could have
multiple definitions, and resolving this can be complex.

\subsection{Renaming}

As shown earlier, in Magnolia, one can make some concept, and reuse this concept
in another one. An example of this can be shown in listings \ref{lst:foo}, and
\ref{lst:bar}, where we have the concept \textit{Foo} being used in \ref{lst:bar}.

String concatenation is a monoid, so is list concatenation.
\todo{Add proof? Isomorphism?}

Even though they are related, it is more useful to have specific names for each
concept. In \ref{lst:strConc} and \ref{list:listConc} we are importing the
monoid, (from listing \ref{lst:monoid}), and renaming the \textbf{unit} and
\textbf{binop} operation to something that are specific to the concepts,
\textbf{emptyString}, $+$ and \textbf{emptyList}, $++$ respectively.

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={String concatenation (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:strConc
    ]{./code/string-conc.mg}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
  \lstinputlisting
    [ language=Magnolia
    , caption={String concatenation (Magnolia)}
    , label=lst:lstConc
    ]{./code/list-conc.mg}
\end{center}

\subsection{Dependency Cycles}

Programming languages have different ways to avoid the problem of imports of
modules forming a cyclic graph. The easiest, is to simply disallow such import
structures, which is something Magnolia does. All imports have to be
\gls{dag}'s. In most programming languages this is trivial to solve for
developers, as if suddenly a project has a cyclic import, it can be solved quite
easily. This could be complex, but in most cases this is an easy fix. However,
due to the heavy reuse in Magnolia, the cycles could be quite large and harder
to reason about without a tool to visualize the dependency graph.

\subsection{External software dependency}

Magnolia depends on a compiler, like all compiled programming languages, but
also an \gls{smt} solver. While the new compiler for Magnolia, at the time of
writing is still under development, \cite{wiig}, but once released will be quite
stable. This is in contrast to the \gls{smt} solver environment. Skogvik
\cite{beateVerification} noted the different competitions for developers of
\gls{smt} solvers, this means there might be a new and better \gls{smt} solver,
which means it needs to be easy for a user of the \gls{ide} to change the
\gls{smt} solver they are using to validate their program with.

Mention \gls{asr}s?

\section{Zero Core IDE}

\todo{Add intro}

There is also a provider, some module providing data, and some consumer, some
module using the data. If either the consumer or the provider is maintained by a
third party, then there is some informal \textit{contract} between them. The
consumer expects the outputs of a provider to be in some certain format, which
in the case for \gls{rest} \gls{api}s usually is \gls{json}, but with
specification formats like OpenApi \cite{openApi}, one can also specify the
structure of the \gls{json} response, with what fields and values it can have.
One can also specify what values are valid in a request. But even if one does
use such a format, changes in scope can require the provider to change the
\gls{api}, which could affect the consumer, because the consumer assumed
something about their informal contract, that all numbers provided are
integers, for example. And if suddenly the provider changes, and returns
floating point numbers, the consumer could crash trying to parse a string as
an integer.

The same concept applies to a zero core \gls{ide}. Modules have an implicit, and
informal contract between them. So the same measures, used in microservice
architecture, to mitigate these issues, can be used in this zero core \gls{ide}.
Unit testing of code is essential in software development, especially when
developing against third party systems. Instead, invoking these third party
systems at test time, mocking is used. This mocking is part of how a consumer
assumes a provider should act. Mocking of modules is trivial, as all one needs
to mock is the state, the \gls{ui}, or that some event happens. At a larger
scale we test the module family, to see if its change has affected the other
modules. This can be done with contract testing, as discussed by Gross and Mayer
\cite{GROSS200322}. They propose a module architecture, where each module expose
some testing interface. However, in the architecture propose by us, all modules
composing the \gls{ide} can be loaded in a test environment, where all
interactions are recorded, and used to generate a dependency graph, showing what
modules depend on whom. This can show that certain modules are more tightly
connected than assumed, meaning they are in the same module family, it can also
show what module families communicate with other module families, showing module
communities.
